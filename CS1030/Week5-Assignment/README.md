For this assignment you'll be using MS Access. If you don't have it you can download it for free from the university through Office 365. Which you can access here with your student email address: office365.com/education (Links to an external site.). Alternatively, you can use an older version of MS Access via Athena (Links to an external site.). 

# Database Assignment - Part #1
Create a database in Microsoft Access containing two tables.  The first table will contain information for at least 10 of contacts (real or made-up.)  Be sure to include name, full address, phone numbers, and e-mail address. The second table will contain your class schedule.  Be sure to include the course ID, course name, beginning and ending times, professor, and any other information you find pertinent. How you choose to divide up the fields is up to you, but you may want to look at the SQL select statements in the second part of the assignment before you assign the fields.

# Database Assignment – Part #2
Create and save queries using SQL in Microsoft Access that will do the following:
Query 1 – Select all fields in the Contact table, ordered by last name.
Query 2 – Select first name, last name, and e-mail address in the Contact table, ordered by e-mail address.
Query 3 – Select first name, last name, and city in the Contacts table for any contacts who don’t live in Utah, ordered by Zip Code.
Query 4 – Select course ID and time fields in the School table, ordered by course ID.
Query 5 – Select all the classes in the School table by your favorite professor (be very careful on this one... ;), ordered by beginning time.

(If you want credit for the queries, make sure you write the SQL statements out yourself rather than using the built-in Query Wizard.)
