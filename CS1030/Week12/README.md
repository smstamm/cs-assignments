Food Sales Tax:  3.0%
Non-Food Sales Tax:  6.75% 

Food Bill:  $150
Non-Food Bill:  $50

Then print the total taxes in statement that displays the following output exactly: (replace the calculated tax where the brackets indicate, without the actual brackets)

```The total tax for your bill is:  [Total Tax]```
