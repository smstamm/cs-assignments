Write a program that will convert any word the user inputs into "Pig Latin". For any that are not fluent in Pig Latin, here are the rules from Wikipedia:

For words that begin with consonants, the initial consonant or consonant clusteris moved to the end of the word, and "ay" is added, as in the following examples:
* "happy" → "appyhay"
* "glove" → "oveglay"
* "school" → "oolschay"

For words that begin with vowels, "way" is added at the end of the word. Examples are
* "egg" → "eggway"
* "inbox" → "inboxway"
* "eight" → "eightway"
