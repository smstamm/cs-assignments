CS 1400 - Hilton

Write a "Higher / Lower" game where the user tries to guess a random number between 1 and 100. Give the user hints as they guess as to whether the correct number is higher or lower than their guess. Keep track of the number of valid guesses. If the user enters a number that is outside the range of numbers, prompt the user to enter a valid number. When the user correctly guesses the number, the user wins, and the game ends. Display the number of tries it took to guess the correct number.

Sample Session:

*Welcome to the Higher / Lower game! Try to guess the number between 1 and 100.*
*Enter your guess:*
**-5**
*Sorry, the guess needs to be a number between 1 and 100. Please try again:*
**-10**
*Sorry, the guess needs to be a number between 1 and 100. Please try again:*
**50**
*The number is higher. Enter your guess:*
**75**
*The number is lower. Enter your guess:*
**63**
*The number was 63! You guessed correctly! It took you 3 tries.*
