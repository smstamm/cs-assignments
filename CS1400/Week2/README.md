 I donâ€™t know about you, but I love a good road trip! If you drive slowly on a road trip, it will take longer to reach the destination. If you drive fast, it stands to reason that you will arrive faster. I know that none of you would ever intentionally speed. But, hypothetically, how much time do you actually save by driving faster?
 
 Write a Java program that calculates how many minutes will be saved on a drive by driving faster than the speed limit. Prompt the user to enter:
 
 * Name of the destination
 * Number of miles to the destination
 * Speed limit
 * How many mph over the speed limit you wish to drive
 
 Calculate the result in minutes, and print the results for the user.
 
 Sample session:
 *Please enter your destination:*  
 **Kearney, Nebraska**  
 *How many miles is it to Kearney, Nebraska?:  
 **743**  
 *What is the speed limit?*  
 **80**  
 *How fast do you plan on driving over the speed limit (in mph)?:*  
 **5**  
 
 *You will arrive in Kearney, Nebraska 32.77941176470591 minutes faster by driving 5.0 mph over the speed limit.*
