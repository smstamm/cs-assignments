# Mission 1

CS 1400 - Hilton

Build a Java program that prints out the following information:

*My name is [Your Name]. My favorite movie is [Your Favorite Movie].*

So if I were doing it, my output would look like this:

*My name is Spencer Hilton. My favorite movie is Warrior.*

As you name your files, please name them with the assignment "Mission01" and then your last name with a .java extension (unless otherwise indicated). So if it were me, I would submit the file as "Mission01Hilton.java". Attach the .java file and submit the program through Canvas. NOTE:  Proper indentation, commenting, Java programming conventions, and general readability are an important part of programming that can set apart a good programmer from an excellent programmer. Part of your score on each assignment (approximately 10%) will be based on those readability elements.
