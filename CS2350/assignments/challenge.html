        <h1>Challenge Activities</h1>

        <h2>Pet Competition Form</h2>
        <p>This project tasked students with building an HTML form that includes text inputs, date inputs, radio buttons, select drop-down, text area, buttons and more.</p>
        <p>Steph loves all things pets, so she found the theme to be fun. She also felt like this project was a nice break from thinking too hard about styling.</p>
        <p>She was rather surprised with how much functionality is "baked" into the browser. She hadn't used fieldsets or legends previously, and also learned to limit the HTTP methods, which is a great security add-on.</p>

        <h2>Graphic Design for Assignments Website</h2>
        <p>Steph learned how to use an image map for the first time. Plus she got to play with text and box shadows more than ever before.</p>
        <p>She likes the way the header image came out. It's popping a bit more now than it had been with increased contrast.</p>
        <p>Steph found her OCD was somewhat triggered by having different styles on images throughout the website, but she realizes it's all in the pursuit of learning!</p>

        <h2>Story Pages</h2>
        <p>This activity challenged students to design two pages with identical HTML content but styled differently with pure CSS.</p>
        <p>While Steph was already familiar with page layout using CSS Grid, she did discover some new ways to use it by allowing a single element to span several columns even if row content changes. This allowed her to apply classes sparingly and save a few lines of code.</p>
        <p>Steph really struggles with creativity and probably spent way too long designing this project, but she thoroughly enjoyed the subject matter so it made the project quite fun.</p>

            </div>
        </section>

        <h2>Assignments Website</h2>
        <p>Steph already had a pretty good handle on writing semantic HTML and CSS, but had never used the <code>article</code> or <code>section</code> tags so that was a new learning experience. She has also never targeted CSS by ID, so that was a good reminder of additional tools in the toolbox.</p>
        <p>She enjoyed having some parameters to work within, and that there were plenty of HTML and CSS examples to draw inspiration from.</p>
        <p>Creative freedom makes Steph uncomfortable because it feels too wide open, so styling a project from scratch was challenging. However, with several aesthetic templates to draw from, she could focus a bit more on the content and resume calm breathing.</p>
